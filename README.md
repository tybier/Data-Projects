# Data-Projects
My portfolio of various data projects using various machine learning models and analytical processes. Contents include:

A comparison of regression models on estimating the amount of monetary loss sustained from house fires using national fire incident reporting system pulic data data (NFIRS). Various machine learning models are utilized with R. Specifically a multiple linear regression model, a stepwise regression model, a random forest model and their respective accuracy metrics are compared/ contrasted to determine best fit on data.
