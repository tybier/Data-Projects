# Data-Projects
My portfolio of sample data projects using various machine learning methods and analytical processes, mainly using R. Each project has an associated .docx file attached for viewing. Projects include:

An in-depth comparison of regression models on estimating the amount of monetary loss sustained from house fires using national fire incident reporting system pulic data data (NFIRS). Various machine learning models are utilized with R. Specifically a multiple linear regression model, a stepwise regression model, a random forest model and their respective accuracy metrics are compared/ contrasted to determine best fit on data. This file contains a word document showing comprehensive documentation, commentary, analysis, and R code. 

The creation of a recurrent neural network (RNN) that can categorize customer sentiment data as positive or negative using customer reviews. 

Forecasting future hospital revenue using time series modeling (ARIMA model). 

Using a K-means model as a clustering method. Specifically using the model with a medical dataset to cluster/ group patients to determine if there is a relationship between income levels and number of days admitted within the hospital. 

Market basket analysis on a medical dataset that lists all prescriptions for patients admitted within a hospital. Analysis is used to determine which medications are most commonly prescribed to patients in conjunction with adderall. As well as investigating whether or not patients prescribed adderall are likely to be prescribed other psychiatric medications. 

Using a K-nearest neighbor algorithm for classification: To predict whether a medical patient will be readmitted to the hospital after initial hospital discharge. Variables used for prediction include a patient's prior medical history, socioeconomic factors, regional factors, etc.
